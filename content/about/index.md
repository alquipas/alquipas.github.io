## Short Description
I am a Spanish Linux Sysadmin. I like to learn, mainly new technologies and ways of working that I can apply to become a better technician. Passionate about automation and DevOps culture. I focus on doing my work right and secure, work out, travel and spend time with friends and family. I also love all kinds of music but live.

Sometimes I appear in videos of friends.
