## Who Am I
I'm Alejandro, a geek guy from Valencia (Spain). I became passionate about Linux doing my practices and since then I've wanted to become a great Sysadmin. Along the way, I've learnt a lot, and I've got new passions, like automation or the [DevOps culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps). Nowadays I even get attracted by coding -my sysadmin soul hurts when I say it out loud-.

I work as "DevOps Engineer and System Administrator" at [LORIOT](https://loriot.io/)

I do more things but these are the techie ones.

Bonus track: Here's a video of an amazing trip I took with some former colleagues but great friends.
