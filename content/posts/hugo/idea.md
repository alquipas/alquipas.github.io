## Main Idea
I wanted to create my own website. But writing code? Buff ... I only like to code to automate. Begin to remember HTML and CSS again to create a web isn't funny and obiously JavaScript is forbidden.
Doing my usually search of projects and technologies I came to a website with a lot of "good stuff". Open Source technologies and projects, this website was [https://after-dark.habd.as/](https://after-dark.habd.as/)
> After Dark is open source software you can use to build a secure website, blog or app.

I though "Great!" the website mention all features, modules and projects used to create your own site and I started to take a look on them until I reach [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/)
> The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites

That's it! Sounds powerful! Stay tuned to know how I did it.
